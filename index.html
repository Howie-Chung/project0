        <p class="p-block">Hello, Professor Marc.<br />
            I apologize for not noticing the Introduction assignment. I recall checking the course site last week and
            did not see it at that time. If I submit my response here, would you be willing to consider granting partial
            credit? I completely understand if that is not possible, but I wanted to ask.<br /> I’m very happy to have
            the opportunity to take this JavaScript course, and I truly believe it will help me gain a deeper
            understanding of the subject.
        </p>

        <div class="p-block">
            <h4 class="fw-bold">Q1.What name do you prefer to be called?</h4>
            <p>A1.You can call me Howie.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="p-block">
            <h4 class="fw-bold">Q2.Have you done any coding of any kind? </h4>
            <p>A2.I’ve been working as a UX/UI designer for almost 7 years, but I started learning HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript about 5 years ago. I’m very comfortable with HTML and CSS. For JavaScript, I mostly modify
                templates and adjust values—I’m not very confident writing it from scratch. Also, at my previous company
                we had dedicated front-end engineers, so after I completed the design and built the static site, I would
                hand it off to the front-end engineer to implement the rest.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="p-block">
            <h4 class="fw-bold">Q3.What have you created using code?</h4>
            <p>A3.During my time at my previous company, I completed 130+ layout implementation projects, working with
                clients ranging from airlines and government agencies to universities and museums.</p>

        <div class="p-block">
            <h4 class="fw-bold">Q4.What experience in creating digital media do you already have?</h4>
            <p>A4.My primary expertise is UX/UI design, with a strong background in visual design. I also have
                experience in video editing and motion graphics. During my undergraduate studies, my capstone project
                was an app-based game centered around GPS, strategy, and collection mechanics. I was mainly responsible
                for the UI design and in-game visual effects. At the time, I taught myself After Effects to complete the
                motion effects. The project won 4 awards for both my team and me, and it ultimately solidified my
                decision to pursue a career in design.</p>

        <div class="p-block">
            <h4 class="fw-bold">Q5.What digital media creation tools have you used?</h4>
            <p>A5.Figma, Adobe XD, Illustrator, Photoshop, After Effect, premiere</p>
        </div>

        <div class="p-block">
            <h4 class="fw-bold">Q6.Where did you get your undergraduate degree?</h4>
            <p>A6.I am Taiwanese. I graduated from the Department of Multimedia Design at Taichung University of Science
                and Technology.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="p-block">
            <h4 class="fw-bold">Q7.Do you have any other degrees or advanced certifications in other subjects?
            </h4>
            <p>A7.No, I don't have it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="p-block">
            <h4 class="fw-bold">Q8.What is one topic about which you're quite knowledgeable? </h4>
            <p>A8.I wouldn’t say I’m extremely knowledgeable, but I do have some experience with photography. I’ve
                participated in a few photography competitions in the past and even won some awards. When I travel, I
                don’t really care about what I buy or what I eat. What matters most to me is whether I can capture good
                photos of the places I researched beforehand. Haha.

        <div class="p-block">
            <h4 class="fw-bold">Q12.What's your favorite place in the world?</h4>
            <p>A12.Japan. I spent a month there in the summer of 2024, visiting the professor who mentored me in college
                as well as some friends. I really loved the quiet and well-organized atmosphere.</p>
